# BasalMeltCoupling

This repository contains the code for the freshwater coupling between BISICLES and EC-Earth3. 

For this code to function, you need to be working on a branch of EC-Earth3, which contains some changes for the freshwater distribution as well as an option for the BISICLES coupling. This can be found, along with this code, on the svn branch `branch name`. You also need to have BISICLES compiled somewhere on your system, instruction on how to do this can be found [here](https://davis.lbl.gov/Manuals/BISICLES-DOCS/readme.html), more specific ECMWF instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/BISICLES-users/BISICLES-notes/blob/main/BISICLES_ECMWF2020.md).
